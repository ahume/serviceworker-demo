TODO

- reload worker when it changes
    - onupdated
    - Cache#update
- AsyncMap... isn't async.
- Relative/absolute URLs
    - relative to serviceworker... but where's the worker?
- what happens if there's a cache miss to a 404ing page?
- x-origin stuff?
- error handling is generally inconsistent and shoddy
- load worker from requested page!
